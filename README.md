Property Tax Calculator!

Purpose: The purpose of this program is to display a GUI using tkinter, to display a place where users can choose a property value and find the tax associated with it. This was the first time using tkinter for a program, so the importance is focused on the GUI components rather than the usability of the program itself.

How  it Works: Tkinter is imported into the python file. Once you run the python file, a pop up will appear displaying a list of numbers. There are 5 numbers ranging from 5,000 to 100,000. Once a number is chosen, the assessment value and property tax value is shown below. 

Limitations: Since this was practice, there is no place for the user to input their own information. They aonly have a preselected numbers to choose from, which can limit the use of this. However, The GUI is neat and works properly.
